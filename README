I completed "problem (a)" as my primary assignment, "problem (b)" was completed for the extra credit.

TO COMPILE:
1) Run "make"
2) Run "make jar"

TO USE:
Command syntax: hadoop jar [Jar_Name].jar project1.Main [input_file] [keyword] {-o [output_path]}
 
This program takes two manditory parameters: [input_file], [keyword]. One optional parameter, -o [output_path]; if not supplied
 the default values is your home hadoop directory.

Once submitted the application will prompt you for which program you would like to run. ArticleCounter (1) is "problem (a)" from the 
assignement description, FiveMostCommonCounter (2) is "problem (b)". Once selected, you will press enter and the program will begin 
execution.

ArticleCounter output:
The output contains each article ID and the number 1 where a match was found. At the end of the output there is a total value which
indicates the total number of articles which contain the keyword, [keyword].

FiveMostCommonCounter output:
The output contains the number of occurance of each word in every article with a title that contains the keyword, [keyword]. At 
the end of the output, the five most common words are returned with the number of occurances. 

TESTING:
When searching for the keyword "the", ArticleCounter should output a file whose last line is "Total Count	3416699"

When searching for the keyword "Hello World", FiveMostCommonCounter should output a file whose last 5 lines are 
"1st paragraph	14
2nd param	13
3rd heading	12
4th n	11
5th name	11"
